# Pacer web editor

Program your Nektar Pacer MIDI controler with your web browser. 


# Requirements &amp; Limitations

:warning: This application requires a browser that support the [Web MIDI API](http://webaudio.github.io/web-midi-api/).

Currently, only **Chrome 43+** and **Opera 44+** support this standard. This app will therefore _not_ work in Firefox, Safari or IE. 

The Chrome browser is highly recommended. 

This app has mainly be tested with Chrome on a MacBook pro running OS X 10. Some tests have been done with success with Chrome under Linux Mint 17.1. 
The application has never been tested under Windows. Any Windows feedback is very welcome.

Still under active development. Feel free to log bugs/issues. This is a development I'm doing during my freetime. 


# Usage

1. Open https://sysex.io/pacer/
2. Allow the browser to use your MIDI devices
3. If it's not already done, connect your Nektar Pacer to your computer.
4. When the Pacer is connected the application logo will glow.

The logo glows when the Pacer is connected and recognized by the application:
